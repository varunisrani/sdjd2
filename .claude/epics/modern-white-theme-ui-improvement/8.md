# Task 8: Accessibility Compliance

## Description

Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the modern white theme UI with comprehensive focus on contrast ratios, focus states, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels. This task verifies that all accessibility standards are met before production launch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Contrast Ratios**: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text (verified across all components)
- **Focus Indicators**: 3px solid outline with high contrast, visible on all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements fully accessible via keyboard
- **ARIA Labels**: Icon-only buttons have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Successfully tested with NVDA and VoiceOver

## Technical Details

### Automated Testing
- Run `axe DevTools` audit against all refactored components
- Execute Lighthouse accessibility audit for each page
- Generate automated accessibility report
- Fix any critical and high-priority issues identified

### Contrast Fixes
- Audit all text colors against background colors
- Update color system tokens if contrast ratios fall below thresholds
- Test in both light and dark modes (if applicable)
- Verify contrast in disabled and hover states

### ARIA Implementation
- Add/update ARIA labels for:
  - Icon-only buttons (play, pause, next, previous, search)
  - Skip links and navigation elements
  - Form inputs and labels
  - Dynamic content regions
- Implement ARIA live regions for status updates
- Add aria-expanded/aria-controls for collapsible elements

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
- Tab order verification (logical flow through UI)
- Test all interactive elements via keyboard (Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Test focus trap in modals/dialogs
- Verify Escape key closes overlays
- Test form submission via keyboard

### Screen Reader Testing
- Test with NVDA on Windows (latest version)
- Test with VoiceOver on macOS/iOS
- Verify all content is announced properly
- Test navigation and command execution
- Verify form validation messages
