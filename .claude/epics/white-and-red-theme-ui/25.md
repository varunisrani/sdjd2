# Task: Apply Theme to SearchBar Component

## Description
Refactor the SearchBar component to use the white and red theme system. Implement white input field background with red focus border, red search icon/button, and light gray placeholder text for optimal user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] White input field background using `--color-primary`
- [ ] Red focus border using `--color-border-focus`

- [ ] Light gray placeholder text using `--color-text-tertiary`
- [ ] All hardcoded colors replaced with CSS variables
- [ ] Focus state clearly visible with proper outline
- [ ] Search functionality unchanged
- [ ] No console errors

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
1. Update input field styles with CSS variables
2. Implement red focus border state

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `components/SearchBar.tsx` (or .jsx)
- `components/SearchBar.module.css`
