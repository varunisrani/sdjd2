# Task: Documentation and Production Build Verification

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for the theme system usage and verify the production build completes successfully with acceptable performance metrics. Document all CSS variables, Tailwind configuration, and component theming patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Theme usage guide created documenting all CSS variables
- [ ] Tailwind configuration documented
- [ ] Component theming patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Production build completes successfully
- [ ] Bundle size increase is <2% compared to baseline
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Build time within 5% of current duration
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
1. Create theme documentation (README or docs file)
2. Document all 15 CSS variables with usage examples
3. Document Tailwind theme extension configuration
4. Provide component theming pattern examples
5. Run production build and verify success
6. Compare bundle sizes before/after
7. Benchmark build time
8. Document any performance considerations

**Key considerations:**
- Documentation should be clear for future developers
- Include code examples for common use cases
- Document any gotchas or edge cases discovered
- Provide migration guide if needed

**Code locations/files affected:**
- New documentation file (e.g., THEME_GUIDE.md)
- Update main README if needed
- Build configuration files for verification

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007 completed (all testing done)
- [ ] All components themed and tested
- [ ] Production build environment available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: false (final task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Theme documentation written and comprehensive
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Bundle size verified (<2% increase)
- [ ] Build time verified (within 5%)
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity
- [ ] All documentation committed to git
- [ ] Epic ready for final review and closure
