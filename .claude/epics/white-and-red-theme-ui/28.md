# Task: Accessibility and Cross-Browser Testing

## Description
Conduct comprehensive accessibility and cross-browser testing to ensure WCAG AA compliance and visual consistency across all major browsers. Verify color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and screen reader compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components pass axe-core DevTools accessibility audit (zero violations)
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA contrast standards (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works correctly across all components
- [ ] Focus indicators visible with 3px minimum outline
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (no color-dependent information)
- [ ] Visual consistency verified in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Responsive testing completed on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in any browser

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
1. Run axe-core DevTools extension on all pages/components
2. Use WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify color ratios
3. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space)
4. Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
5. Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge browsers
6. Test on mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), tablet, desktop
7. Document any issues found and fix immediately

**Key considerations:**
- Test all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Verify color contrast in both light and varied lighting conditions
- Ensure focus indicators are not obscured by other elements
- Check for FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

**Code locations/files affected:**
- All themed components
- May require minor fixes in any component file

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 27 completed (all components themed)
- [ ] Access to multiple browsers for testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing tools installed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all components completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed with zero violations
- [ ] All contrast ratios documented and compliant
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested and documented
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Responsive testing completed
- [ ] Any issues found have been fixed
- [ ] Testing results documented
- [ ] Final review completed
