# Task: Refactor TrackList Component Styling

## Description
Update TrackList component CSS to use Spotify green theme for play button icons, active track indicators, and hover states while maintaining the existing mobile-first responsive layout.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Play button icons updated to green (#1DB954)
- [ ] Active/playing track shows green accent indicator
- [ ] Hover states use light green tint (#F1F1F1 background, green text)
- [ ] Text color hierarchy matches new neutral palette
- [ ] Row alternating colors work with white background
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions preserved
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA contrast on white background

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Update `TrackList.module.css` with green color values
- Use CSS variables for consistency with globals.css
- Update active state indicators to green
- Maintain existing grid/flex layout unchanged

**Key considerations:**
- Second-most visible component (track listings)
- Active track needs clear visual distinction with green
- Hover effects should be subtle but noticeable
- Text hierarchy must be readable on white

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\TrackList.tsx`
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\TrackList.module.css`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 31 must be completed (CSS variables foundation)
- [ ] Browser DevTools for visual testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing for responsive behavior

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can work simultaneously with Task 32, different files)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with green accent system
- [ ] Component tested in isolation and with player
- [ ] Active track clearly distinguishable with green
- [ ] Hover states smooth and accessible
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Changes committed atomically
