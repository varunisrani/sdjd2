# Task: Refactor NowPlaying Component Styling

## Description
Update NowPlaying component CSS with light green background tint and green accent colors to match the Spotify theme, ensuring proper text contrast and visual hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Background updated to light green tint (#E8F5E9)
- [ ] Accent colors use green palette
- [ ] Text colors use neutral hierarchy (readable on light green)
- [ ] Album art styling preserved
- [ ] Track metadata readable and accessible
- [ ] Mobile layout unchanged
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast maintained on tinted background

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Update `NowPlaying.module.css` with green tints
- Use --now-playing-bg variable from globals.css (#E8F5E9)
- Adjust text colors if needed for contrast on tinted background
- Preserve existing component structure

**Key considerations:**
- Light green background provides subtle "now playing" indicator
- Text must remain readable on tinted background
- Component typically shown in sidebar or footer
- Should complement but not compete with main player

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\NowPlaying.tsx`
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\NowPlaying.module.css`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 31 must be completed (CSS variables foundation)
- [ ] Contrast validation tools for tinted background
- [ ] Visual testing in context with other components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2 hours
- Parallel: true (independent component update)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with light green tint
- [ ] Text contrast validated on new background
- [ ] Component tested in sidebar/footer context
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clear and accessible
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Changes committed atomically
