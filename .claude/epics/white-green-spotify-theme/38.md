# Task: Cross-Browser and Performance Testing

## Description
Validate visual consistency and performance across all supported browsers and devices. Ensure the theme renders correctly and maintains performance scores across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on both desktop and mobile.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chrome 90+ rendering validated (desktop and mobile)
- [ ] Firefox 88+ rendering validated
- [ ] Safari 14+ rendering validated (desktop and iOS)
- [ ] Edge 90+ rendering validated
- [ ] Mobile Chrome and iOS Safari tested
- [ ] Tablet responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >= 90 (unchanged from baseline)
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.2s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] No CSS rendering bugs or fallback issues
- [ ] No increase in CSS bundle size

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Manual testing on physical devices and browser VMs
- Lighthouse audit before/after comparison
- Screenshot comparison across browsers
- Performance monitoring in DevTools
- CSS bundle size comparison

**Key considerations:**
- CSS variables well-supported in modern browsers
- No polyfills needed for target browser versions
- Performance impact should be zero (CSS-only changes)
- Visual consistency critical for brand experience

**Code locations/files affected:**
- All CSS files (validation only)
- Lighthouse reports (documentation)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 31-36 must be completed (all component updates done)
- [ ] Browser testing environment setup
- [ ] Lighthouse CLI or browser extension
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics captured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside accessibility testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All target browsers tested and validated
- [ ] Screenshots captured for visual comparison
- [ ] Lighthouse audit completed and compared to baseline
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
- [ ] Any browser-specific issues identified and fixed
- [ ] Cross-browser test report created
