# Task: Refactor MusicPlayer Component Styling

## Description
Update MusicPlayer component CSS to align with Spotify white & green theme. Focus on play/pause button, progress bar, volume slider, and control icons with green accents while maintaining mobile-responsive behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Play/pause button uses circular green design (#1DB954)
- [ ] Progress bar fill updated to green with hover effects
- [ ] Volume slider indicators updated to green
- [ ] All control icons use appropriate green/neutral colors
- [ ] Hover and active states use green palette
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior unchanged
- [ ] All interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Update `MusicPlayer.module.css` with new color values
- Leverage CSS variables from globals.css where possible
- Fine-tune component-specific colors that don't inherit automatically
- Preserve all existing animations and transitions

**Key considerations:**
- Most high-impact visual component (music player is focal point)
- Touch targets must remain accessible on mobile
- Green on white contrast must be validated
- Smooth hover/active state transitions

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\MusicPlayer.tsx`
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\MusicPlayer.module.css`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 31 must be completed (CSS variables foundation)
- [ ] Browser DevTools for live testing
- [ ] WebAIM contrast checker for validation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 31)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all green accents
- [ ] Component tested in isolation on dev server
- [ ] Contrast ratios validated (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior verified
- [ ] Hover/active states smooth and consistent
- [ ] Changes committed atomically
