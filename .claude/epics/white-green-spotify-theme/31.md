# Task: Update CSS Variable Foundation

## Description
Update the core design system CSS variables in globals.css to establish the Spotify white & green color palette. This is the foundation task that enables all other component updates through CSS variable cascade.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All primary color variables updated to Spotify green palette (#1DB954, #1AA34A, #1ED760)
- [ ] Neutral text hierarchy updated (#191414, #535353, #B3B3B3)
- [ ] Background system updated to white/light gray (#FFFFFF, #F6F6F6, #E0E0E0)
- [ ] Music-specific colors defined (now-playing-bg, track-hover, control-active)
- [ ] All changes documented with inline comments
- [ ] Dev server running shows immediate visual changes across all components

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Update CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css`
- Replace all blue color references with green equivalents
- Maintain mobile-responsive breakpoints unchanged
- Preserve all existing animation/transition values

**Key considerations:**
- Atomic change - updates cascade to all components automatically
- Pre-validate all color combinations for WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1)
- Use Spotify's tested brand colors for accessibility compliance
- Zero component logic changes required

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\app\globals.css`

## Dependencies
- [ ] No external dependencies - can start immediately
- [ ] Completed mobile-responsive refactoring (already done)
- [ ] Completed design system foundation (already done)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (independent task, no conflicts)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all color variables updated
- [ ] Visual verification in running dev server
- [ ] Comments updated to reflect new color purposes
- [ ] No unused blue color variables remaining
- [ ] Changes committed atomically
