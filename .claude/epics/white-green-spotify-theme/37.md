# Task: Accessibility Testing and WCAG Validation

## Description
Comprehensive accessibility testing to ensure all color changes meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, keyboard navigation works correctly, and the interface is usable for users with visual impairments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Focus indicators meet 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- [ ] WAVE browser extension shows zero contrast errors
- [ ] axe DevTools shows zero accessibility violations
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functional across all components
- [ ] Color not sole indicator of information (icons + text labels)
- [ ] Colorblind simulation tested (green appears with text context)
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (basic navigation)

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Run WAVE extension on all major pages
- Run axe DevTools automated scan
- Manual keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrows)
- Use WebAIM contrast checker for spot validation
- Test with colorblind simulation tools
- Basic screen reader testing (NVDA/VoiceOver)

**Key considerations:**
- Green on white can have contrast issues if not carefully selected
- Spotify's brand colors pre-tested for accessibility
- Focus indicators critical for keyboard users
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible

**Code locations/files affected:**
- All component files (validation only, minimal fixes expected)
- Potential minor contrast adjustments in CSS files

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 31-36 must be completed (all component updates done)
- [ ] WAVE browser extension installed
- [ ] axe DevTools browser extension installed
- [ ] WebAIM contrast checker available
- [ ] Screen reader software available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all component work completed first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WAVE scan completed with zero critical errors
- [ ] axe DevTools scan passed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation verified on all pages
- [ ] Contrast ratios documented and validated
- [ ] Any accessibility issues fixed and re-tested
- [ ] Accessibility test report created
