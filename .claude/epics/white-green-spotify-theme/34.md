# Task: Refactor SearchBar Component Styling

## Description
Update SearchBar component CSS with green focus states, result hover effects, and selected item highlighting while maintaining mobile-responsive search functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Focus outline/ring updated to green (#1DB954)
- [ ] Search result hover states use light green tint
- [ ] Selected/active result highlighted with green accent
- [ ] Input placeholder text uses tertiary neutral color (#B3B3B3)
- [ ] Clear/cancel button icons updated to neutral palette
- [ ] Mobile keyboard interaction preserved
- [ ] Focus states meet 3:1 contrast ratio requirement

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Update `SearchBar.module.css` with green interactive states
- Use CSS focus-visible for keyboard navigation highlighting
- Apply hover effects to search results
- Maintain existing search logic unchanged

**Key considerations:**
- Focus indicators critical for accessibility
- Green focus ring must be clearly visible on white
- Search results need distinct hover vs selected states
- Mobile search interaction must remain intuitive

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\SearchBar.tsx`
- `C:\Users\Varun israni\sdjd2\components\SearchBar.module.css`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 31 must be completed (CSS variables foundation)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation testing required
- [ ] Mobile device testing for focus behavior

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can work independently from other components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with green focus/hover states
- [ ] Component tested with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus indicators clearly visible (3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Search results hover/selection distinct
- [ ] Mobile search functionality verified
- [ ] Changes committed atomically
