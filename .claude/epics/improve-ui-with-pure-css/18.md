# Task: Add mobile responsive enhancements

## Description
Add final mobile responsive enhancements across all components, ensure all touch targets meet 44x44px minimum, test responsive breakpoints, and add optional mobile hamburger menu if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All interactive elements have 44x44px minimum touch targets
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints tested: 320px, 375px, 640px, 768px, 1024px
- [ ] Typography scales appropriately on mobile
- [ ] Spacing is optimized for small screens
- [ ] Hamburger menu added for mobile sidebar (optional enhancement)
- [ ] Mobile navigation smooth and intuitive
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any screen size
- [ ] Touch interactions feel natural (no hover-only features)

## Technical Details
**Files to modify:**
- All CSS Module files created in tasks 13-17
- Potentially add new `components/MobileMenu.module.css` if hamburger menu added

**Implementation approach:**
1. Audit all components for touch target sizes:
   - Buttons, links, clickable elements
   - Ensure minimum 44x44px (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)

2. Test responsive breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 320px-640px
   - Tablet: 641px-1024px
   - Desktop: 1025px+

3. Optimize mobile typography:
   - Check font sizes are readable (minimum 16px for body text)
   - Ensure line heights are comfortable on small screens

4. Add hamburger menu (optional):
   - Create toggle button in header
   - Animate sidebar slide-in/out
   - Add overlay for modal-style sidebar on mobile

5. Test touch interactions:
   - Verify no hover-only features that break on mobile
   - Ensure tap targets are easy to hit

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] iPhone SE (375px width)
- [ ] iPhone 12 Pro (390px width)
- [ ] iPad (768px width)
- [ ] Desktop (1024px+ width)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 13-17 must be completed (all components migrated)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1.5 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on all component migrations)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All touch targets verified 44x44px minimum
- [ ] All breakpoints tested and working correctly
- [ ] Typography readable on all screen sizes
- [ ] Spacing optimized for mobile
- [ ] Optional hamburger menu implemented (if decided)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling issues
- [ ] Touch interactions feel natural
- [ ] Build succeeds, dev server runs without errors
