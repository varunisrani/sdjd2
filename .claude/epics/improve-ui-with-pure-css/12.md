# Task: Enhance globals.css design token system

## Description
Audit and enhance the existing CSS custom properties in globals.css to ensure comprehensive design token coverage for all components. Add any missing tokens needed for the pure CSS migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All design tokens documented with comments
- [ ] Verify all color variables are defined and used consistently
- [ ] Ensure spacing scale covers all component needs
- [ ] Shadow system is complete for all elevation levels
- [ ] Typography scale includes all font sizes used in components
- [ ] Animation timing variables defined (duration, easing)
- [ ] No duplicate or unused CSS variables

## Technical Details
**Files to modify:**
- `app/globals.css`

**Implementation approach:**
1. Review current CSS custom properties (already well-defined)
2. Add any missing tokens discovered during component audit:
   - Animation durations: `--duration-fast: 150ms`, `--duration-normal: 200ms`
   - Easing functions: `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.33, 1, 0.68, 1)`
   - Additional shadows if needed for elevated components
3. Add documentation comments for each section
4. Verify all tokens follow naming convention: `--category-variant`
5. Remove any unused variables (if found)

**Current token categories in globals.css:**
- Colors (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, status)
- Spacing (8px grid system)
- Typography (sizes, line heights, letter spacing)
- Shadows (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Music app specific (player-bg, track-hover, etc.)

**Code locations affected:**
- `app/globals.css` (lines 4-75 contain design tokens)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 11 must be completed (Tailwind removed)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1 hour
- Parallel: false (depends on Task 11)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All design tokens reviewed and enhanced
- [ ] Documentation comments added for clarity
- [ ] No unused CSS variables remaining
- [ ] Design token system ready for component migration
- [ ] Build and dev server run successfully
