# Task: Remove Tailwind CSS and setup foundation

## Description
Remove Tailwind CSS dependency from the project by cleaning up package.json and globals.css. This foundational task ensures a clean slate before migrating to pure CSS Modules.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tailwind CSS import removed from `app/globals.css` (line 1: `@import 'tailwindcss';`)
- [ ] Package.json verified (no removal needed unless npm uninstall run)
- [ ] Project still builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors with `npm run dev`
- [ ] No Tailwind-related console errors or warnings

## Technical Details
**Files to modify:**
- `app/globals.css`: Remove `@import 'tailwindcss';` from line 1

**Implementation approach:**
1. Remove the Tailwind import line from globals.css
2. Keep all existing CSS custom properties (they are framework-agnostic)
3. Keep all utility classes already defined (they're pure CSS)
4. Test build to ensure no breaking changes
5. Verify dev server runs cleanly

**Note:** Do NOT run `npm uninstall tailwindcss` yet - wait until all components are migrated to avoid breaking the app during development. The import removal is sufficient to stop using Tailwind.

**Code locations affected:**
- `app/globals.css` (line 1)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is the first task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5 hours
- Parallel: false (must complete first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented (Tailwind import removed)
- [ ] Build passes (`npm run build` succeeds)
- [ ] Dev server runs (`npm run dev` with no errors)
- [ ] All existing CSS custom properties and utilities still work
- [ ] Ready for component migration tasks
