# Task: Validate TrackList Component

## Description

Review and update the TrackList component to ensure complete yellow theme integration. Verify that track hover states, active track indicators, and play button icons properly inherit the yellow theme from CSS custom properties. Fix any hardcoded blue colors that bypass the design token system.

**Component:** `/home/user/sdjd2/components/TrackList.tsx`

This component was recently refactored for mobile-first responsive design (commit 00f4c13), so it should be using CSS custom properties. This task validates theme consistency across all track list interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Track row hover state shows yellow background or accent
- [ ] Active/currently playing track shows yellow indicator
- [ ] Play button icons show yellow when hovered
- [ ] Selected track highlight uses yellow (not blue)
- [ ] No hardcoded blue colors in className or style attributes
- [ ] No blue hex values in inline styles
- [ ] No Tailwind blue classes (`text-blue-600`, `bg-blue-50`, etc.)
- [ ] Track duration and metadata text colors remain neutral (not affected by yellow theme)
- [ ] Zebra striping or alternate row colors (if present) work with yellow accents
- [ ] Focus states for keyboard navigation show yellow outline

## Technical Details

**File to Review:** `/home/user/sdjd2/components/TrackList.tsx`

**Key Areas to Inspect:**

1. **Track Row Hover States:**
   - Verify hover background uses yellow-tinted color
   - Check for hardcoded blue hover classes
   - Validate smooth transition to yellow on hover

2. **Active Track Indicator:**
   - Confirm currently playing track uses yellow highlight
   - Check for blue accent borders or backgrounds
   - Verify visual prominence with yellow theme

3. **Play Button/Icons:**
   - Validate play button shows yellow on hover
   - Check SVG icon colors (fills, strokes)
   - Ensure pause icon (if inline) uses yellow when active

4. **Selection States:**
   - If multi-select enabled, verify checkboxes/selection use yellow
   - Check for blue selection highlight backgrounds
   - Validate yellow provides sufficient contrast for selected state

5. **Common Issues to Fix:**
   ```tsx
   // BAD - Hardcoded blue hover
   <div className="hover:bg-blue-50 active:bg-blue-100">

   // GOOD - Uses design token classes
   <div className="hover:bg-primary-light active:bg-primary">

   // BAD - Blue active indicator
   <div className={isActive ? 'border-l-4 border-blue-600' : ''}>

   // GOOD - Yellow active indicator
   <div className={isActive ? 'border-l-4 border-primary' : ''}>
   ```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Hover over track row - yellow highlight appears
- [ ] Click play on track - active indicator shows yellow
- [ ] Navigate with keyboard - focus ring is yellow
- [ ] Multiple tracks in list - yellow theme consistent across all
- [ ] Long track list (scroll) - yellow theme performance is smooth
- [ ] Mobile view (320px) - yellow indicators still visible and tappable

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Update CSS Design Tokens (must complete first)
- [x] Mobile-first TrackList refactor (commit 00f4c13 - already complete)
- [ ] CSS custom properties propagated from globals.css

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** S (Small)
- **Hours:** 1.5 hours
  - 30 minutes: Code review for hardcoded colors
  - 30 minutes: Fix any discovered issues
  - 15 minutes: Visual testing of hover and active states
  - 15 minutes: Test with multiple tracks and edge cases
- **Parallel:** true (Can run in parallel with tasks 002, 004, 005 after task 001 completes)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code review completed - no hardcoded blue colors found
- [ ] All fixes implemented (if any hardcoded colors discovered)
- [ ] Manual testing passed for all interactive states:
  - Track row hover (idle, hover)
  - Active track indicator (currently playing)
  - Play button hover states
  - Keyboard focus indicators
  - Selection states (if applicable)
- [ ] Tested with varying track list sizes (1 track, 10 tracks, 100+ tracks)
- [ ] Mobile responsive testing (320px, 768px breakpoints)
- [ ] Component-specific changes committed (if any)
- [ ] Yellow theme consistency verified in browser DevTools
- [ ] No console errors or warnings related to color styles
