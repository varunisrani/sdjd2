# Task: Update Remaining Components

## Description

Review and update SearchBar, Playlist, and NowPlaying components to ensure complete yellow theme integration. These three components are grouped together as they are smaller/simpler than MusicPlayer and TrackList. Verify all interactive elements properly inherit yellow theme from CSS custom properties and fix any hardcoded blue colors.

**Components:**
- `/home/user/sdjd2/components/SearchBar.tsx`
- `/home/user/sdjd2/components/Playlist.tsx`
- `/home/user/sdjd2/components/NowPlaying.tsx`

## Acceptance Criteria

**SearchBar Component:**
- [ ] Search input focus state shows yellow border/outline
- [ ] Search icon uses appropriate color (neutral or yellow accent)
- [ ] Clear/cancel button (if present) uses yellow on hover
- [ ] No hardcoded blue focus rings or borders

**Playlist Component:**
- [ ] Playlist selection/highlight uses yellow
- [ ] Playlist hover state shows yellow accent
- [ ] Active playlist indicator uses yellow
- [ ] Playlist action buttons (add, delete) use yellow on hover

**NowPlaying Component:**
- [ ] Currently playing track highlight uses yellow
- [ ] Album art overlay/indicators use yellow accents
- [ ] Interactive elements (like, share) show yellow on hover
- [ ] Focus states for keyboard navigation show yellow outline

**All Three Components:**
- [ ] No hardcoded blue colors in className or style attributes
- [ ] No blue hex values in inline styles
- [ ] No Tailwind blue classes
- [ ] SVG icons inherit correct colors for active/hover states

## Technical Details

**Files to Review:**
1. `/home/user/sdjd2/components/SearchBar.tsx`
2. `/home/user/sdjd2/components/Playlist.tsx`
3. `/home/user/sdjd2/components/NowPlaying.tsx`

**SearchBar - Key Areas:**
- Input focus styles and border colors
- Search icon color (may need yellow accent on focus)
- Autocomplete/suggestions dropdown (if present) - yellow for hover/selected
- Clear button hover state

**Playlist - Key Areas:**
- Playlist item hover backgrounds
- Active/selected playlist indicators
- Playlist metadata that should remain neutral
- Action buttons (create, edit, delete) hover states

**NowPlaying - Key Areas:**
- Currently playing track highlight
- Album art border or overlay accents
- Interactive buttons (like, add to playlist, share)
- Waveform or audio visualizer colors (if present)

**Common Issues to Fix:**
```tsx
// BAD - Hardcoded blue in SearchBar
<input className="focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500" />

// GOOD - Uses design token
<input className="focus:border-primary focus:ring-primary" />

// BAD - Blue playlist highlight
<div className={isActive ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-900' : ''}>

// GOOD - Yellow playlist highlight
<div className={isActive ? 'bg-primary-light text-primary-dark' : ''}>
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] SearchBar: Type in input - yellow focus ring appears
- [ ] SearchBar: Clear button hover - shows yellow
- [ ] Playlist: Hover over playlist - yellow highlight
- [ ] Playlist: Select playlist - active indicator is yellow
- [ ] NowPlaying: Currently playing track shows yellow accent
- [ ] NowPlaying: Like/action buttons hover - show yellow
- [ ] All components: Keyboard navigation shows yellow focus

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Update CSS Design Tokens (must complete first)
- [x] Mobile-first SearchBar refactor (commit 97aac69 - already complete)
- [ ] CSS custom properties propagated from globals.css

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 2.5 hours
  - 1 hour: Code review for all three components
  - 1 hour: Fix any discovered issues across components
  - 30 minutes: Visual testing of all interactive states
- **Parallel:** true (Can run in parallel with tasks 002, 003, 005 after task 001 completes)
