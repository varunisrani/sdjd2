# Task: Accessibility Audit

## Description

Conduct comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance testing for the yellow theme implementation. Run automated accessibility audits, manually test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility, validate contrast ratios for all text and interactive elements, and test with color blindness simulators to ensure the yellow theme is accessible to all users.

This task validates that the yellow theme meets all accessibility requirements defined in the epic's success criteria before moving to production.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Automated Testing:**
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility audit score ≥95 (no regression from blue theme)
- [ ] axe DevTools reports zero critical or serious accessibility violations
- [ ] All automated color contrast checks pass WCAG AA standards

**Contrast Ratios (WCAG AA Compliance):**
- [ ] Normal text (< 18pt): ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Large text (≥18pt or bold ≥14pt): ≥3:1 contrast ratio
- [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs): ≥3:1 against surrounding colors
- [ ] Focus indicators: ≥3:1 contrast with yellow outline visible against all backgrounds
- [ ] Yellow primary (#FFC107) validated: 3.01:1 on white (acceptable for UI components)
- [ ] Yellow dark (#FFA000) validated: 4.53:1 on white (acceptable for text if needed)

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- [ ] All interactive elements reachable via Tab/Shift+Tab
- [ ] Yellow focus indicators visible at all times during keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus order is logical and predictable
- [ ] No keyboard traps (can navigate in and out of all components)
- [ ] Enter/Space activate buttons and controls with yellow feedback
- [ ] Arrow keys work for music player controls (if applicable)

**Screen Reader Compatibility:**
- [ ] Tested with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- [ ] Yellow state changes announced appropriately (e.g., "playing", "selected")
- [ ] Color not used as the only means of conveying information
- [ ] ARIA labels present for icon-only yellow buttons
- [ ] Live regions announce important yellow-indicated state changes
- [ ] All interactive yellow elements have accessible names

**Color Blindness Testing:**
- [ ] Protanopia simulation: Yellow distinguishable from other UI elements
- [ ] Deuteranopia simulation: Yellow provides sufficient differentiation
- [ ] Tritanopia simulation: Yellow theme remains functional
- [ ] Greyscale simulation: Sufficient contrast without color information

**Visual Regression:**
- [ ] No unintended layout shifts from yellow theme changes (CLS ≤0.1)
- [ ] Yellow appears where blue previously appeared (no missing highlights)
- [ ] No unexpected color changes in non-primary elements

## Technical Details

**Tools Required:**

1. **Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):**
   - Run accessibility audit on key pages
   - Compare scores before/after yellow theme
   - Document any new issues introduced

2. **axe DevTools (Browser Extension):**
   - Scan all major components/pages
   - Run full page scan
   - Export report for documentation

3. **WebAIM Contrast Checker:**
   - URL: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
   - Validate #FFC107 (yellow primary)
   - Validate #FFA000 (yellow dark)
   - Test against white, neutral grays, and dark backgrounds

4. **Color Oracle (Color Blindness Simulator):**
   - Test protanopia (red-blind)
   - Test deuteranopia (green-blind)
   - Test tritanopia (blue-blind)
   - Download: https://colororacle.org/

5. **Screen Readers:**
   - NVDA (Windows): https://www.nvaccess.org/
   - VoiceOver (macOS): Built-in (Cmd+F5)
   - ChromeVox (Chrome extension): Optional

**Testing Procedure:**

1. **Automated Audits (30 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
   # Audit > Accessibility > Generate Report
   # Export JSON/HTML for documentation

   # Install and run axe DevTools
   # Scan > Analyze
   # Review issues by impact (critical, serious, moderate)
   ```

2. **Manual Contrast Testing (30 minutes):**
   - Use WebAIM checker for each yellow variant
   - Test against all backgrounds used in app
   - Document contrast ratios in spreadsheet:
     - #FFC107 on white
     - #FFC107 on neutral backgrounds
     - #FFA000 on white (for text)
     - Yellow focus rings on all backgrounds

3. **Keyboard Navigation (45 minutes):**
   - Navigate entire app using only keyboard
   - Verify yellow focus indicators always visible
   - Test all interactive states (hover becomes focus)
   - Document any focus issues

4. **Screen Reader Testing (45 minutes):**
   - Enable NVDA or VoiceOver
   - Navigate through music player, track list, search
   - Verify state changes are announced
   - Check that color isn't sole information carrier

5. **Color Blindness Simulation (30 minutes):**
   - Apply each Color Oracle filter
   - Navigate key user flows in each mode
   - Verify yellow differentiation remains functional
   - Screenshot critical views for documentation

**Common Issues to Address:**
- Insufficient contrast for text on yellow backgrounds
- Yellow focus indicators not visible on certain backgrounds
- Icon-only buttons lacking ARIA labels
- State changes indicated only by yellow color (need text/icon)

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: Update CSS Design Tokens (completed)
- [x] Task 002: Validate MusicPlayer Component (completed)
- [x] Task 003: Validate TrackList Component (completed)
- [x] Task 004: Update Remaining Components (completed)
- [x] Task 005: Update App Layout and Pages (completed)
- [ ] All yellow theme implementation tasks must complete before testing

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 2.5-3 hours
  - 30 minutes: Automated audits (Lighthouse, axe)
  - 30 minutes: Manual contrast ratio testing
  - 45 minutes: Keyboard navigation testing
  - 45 minutes: Screen reader testing
  - 30 minutes: Color blindness simulation
  - 30 minutes: Documentation and remediation (if issues found)
- **Parallel:** false (Must wait for all component updates to complete)
